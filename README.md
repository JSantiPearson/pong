# Pong!
A friend and I created pong with html and javascript in about 3 hours at a hackathon. It utilizes the Two.js library.

## How to install:
 1. Clone this repo
 2. With npm, globally install http-server
 3. Navigate to the repo directory and run http-server
 4. Navigate to the html directory and the game should start
 5. W and S keys for player 1, up and down keys for player 2! Reload if you lose!
